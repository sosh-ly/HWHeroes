- We should interview the included teachers to get an idea for what kinda powers they would like to have / what typa role they feel like they would be!! (+ you can get the voicelines from them)

- if you wanna save some time on graphics, we could go for a more goofy style game where we literally take pictures of the teachers and put them onto models of some kind

- I would love to see more lore added to the game, I'm pretty sure Dawson's idea had some interesting reasons why teachers would fight-- maybe something about the teacher ratings??

-I forgot what game kinda has this (kinda like a train running through a map or what not), but little random events that make the pvp a little harder may be fun--i.e. students flooding the area for a bit as a substitute for a "train" map

MAP IDEAS
- Field capture the point, 1 spawn near hamilton gym & the other one somwhere by rugby
- escort the payload from parking lot up to FH ("sniper" character spots would be fire here)
- Defend the classroom?? student taking a test?
- grade the... paper?? (like bomb defusal but with paper grading idk)

- I would love to add some funny physics so you can knock around the desks and chairs and stuff like in OW

- oh my GOD please add emotes and voice lines (i know mr. nealis has so many though i dunno if hed agree to voice LMAO -- "it's like falling of a log") would also be fire to add voicelines for "ults"
