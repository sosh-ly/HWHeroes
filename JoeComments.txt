- I like the overall design and idea
- I think picking a single game to use as a base would be good.
- I think that Overwatch (OG) UI would suit this game the best.
- For example, WASD to move, special (press shift) tactical (press e), ADS with right click, shooting with left click
- Characters could have specific speed, jump height, sizes, etc but limiting the amount of custom animations/effects/weapons that each needs to a primary, a special and a tactical ability would streamline the planning and dev process
- Since not many people are good at modeling in this class, using voxel modeling like this

 Would be good and simple. 
- I (or you probably) could whip up a character base in Blockbench that people could add details to for each character
- Doing this in Unity would probably make the most sense. There are some good multiplayer tutorials
- We could scan areas at HW with Scaniverse mobile app for maps, upload those into Unity and make mockups with cubes for sizing/distances and then add texture and props to complete it
