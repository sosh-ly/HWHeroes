- Creative idea, sounds fun to play
- Exact game mechanics (specific controls and balancing) have not been worked out yet -- something we'll need to do eventually.
- Sketches of HUD look good to me
- Honor Code and law check: all good
- Abilities also need to be finalized and given precise mechanics
- Harvard-Westlake theme is good -- any specific art directions?
- What kinds of information does the app remember about the user -- what are the rewards for repeated playing?


dawson- 
great idea, seems really fun

Game start- player count should probably be on the lower end(8-10) players to minimize matchmaking time, otherwise need to implement a bot system that scales in difficulty

Gameplay- what happens when neither side progesses for a long time? matches lasting over 30 minutes would probably be a little frustrating. maybe have the overtime be on a timer

is the gameplay more fast paced(higher damage shorter respawn times) or slower paced(higher hp and longer respawn times)

from personal experience, it'd be nice if the mvp of the losing team still gets compensation. it'll lower the frustration of teamates throwing

should have essential shooter mechanics
sensitivy/fov slider, zooming on certain weapons
optimized to be competitve even for lower end devices

what is the progression like? how do you unlock characters? is the matchmaking level based?

I agree with chase, the bulk of art design/controls/abilities/characters are still WIP, but besides that this a really detailed plan :)
