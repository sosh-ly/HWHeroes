- Creative idea, sounds fun to play
- Exact game mechanics (specific controls and balancing) have not been worked out yet -- something we'll need to do eventually.
- Sketches of HUD look good to me
- Honor Code and law check: all good
- Abilities also need to be finalized and given precise mechanics
- Harvard-Westlake theme is good -- any specific art directions?
- What kinds of information does the app remember about the user -- what are the rewards for repeated playing?
