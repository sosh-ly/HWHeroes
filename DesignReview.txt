### Business & Growth

### Potential Risks

**Cheating Concerns:**

**Overall:** HWHeroes has great potential to make homework more engaging. The key is balancing fun game mechanics with actual learning support. Focus on helping students build good habits and stay organized, not just collecting virtual rewards.
